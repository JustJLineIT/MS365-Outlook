<h1>MS Office 365 - AdminCenter /Outlook</h1>

<p>After watching a video from YouTube I watched every day, I signed up for 90 free trial days in the Microsoft Developer Program program. I spent an amount of my time understanding how to manage users and set up rules for the specific group received. Even though I have not yet experience working with a big IT company. This is just to show you I'm very passionate about troubleshooting and resolving future employers' IT needs in the real world. </p>
